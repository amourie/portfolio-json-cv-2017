 DESCRIPTION:

 An improved front-end layout for a JSON based CV. (Was originally done as a front-end portfolio page, done through Udacity.com's Front-End Nano Degree during a trial of their program). In this project I build four JSON data sets, each one representing a different resume section. Next steps were to iterate through each JSON data set's data and append its information to the relevant resume section in the index.html file.

* HTML & CSS
* JSON
* JavaScript
* jQuery
