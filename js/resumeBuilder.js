The roles I've been in, have been hybrid roles exposing me to a range of web development practises, web administration and web project management methodologies. My true passion is web development and I would like to secure a full-time role in web development where I can have the opportunity to focus on web development and grow my skills by learning new technologies, tools and frameworks. I love learning - I find the ever-changing space of web development both exciting and challenging.  It's a very rewarding space to be in. My focus currently is on Full-stack JavaScript development as I wish to eventually specialise in this area. I am not restricted to front-end development as I've done back-end development in the past with .NET C# / Razor Syntax and Umbraco.",
